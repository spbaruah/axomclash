# üèÅ Ludo Race Game

## Overview
The Ludo Race game is a 4-player race-type mini game that replaces the previous Ludo Battle game. Players compete to be the first to get all 4 of their pieces to the finish line.

## Game Rules

### Objective
- Be the first player to get all 4 pieces to the finish line
- The game ends immediately when one player wins
- Other players lose regardless of their progress

### Gameplay
1. **Turn-based**: Players take turns rolling dice and moving pieces
2. **Starting**: A piece can only leave home when the player rolls a 6
3. **Movement**: After rolling, players choose which of their available pieces to move
4. **Path**: Pieces move around the main board path (52 positions)
5. **Finish**: Pieces enter their individual finish path when reaching the correct position
6. **Winning**: First player to get all 4 pieces to the finish line wins

### Piece States
- **Home**: Piece starts in home area, needs a 6 to leave
- **Path**: Piece is moving around the main board
- **Finish**: Piece is in the finish path (6 cells)
- **Finished**: Piece has reached the end of the finish path

### Special Rules
- Rolling a 6 gives an extra turn
- Consecutive sixes are tracked and displayed
- Safe spots on the board protect pieces from capture
- Pieces can capture opponents on non-safe spots
